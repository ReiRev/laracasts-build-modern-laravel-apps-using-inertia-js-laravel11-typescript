## 02 Install and Configure Inertia

### TODO

- [ ] Create a new Laravel project with `laravel new`
- [ ] Finish [server-side setup](https://inertiajs.com/server-side-setup). Note that `Kernel.php` doesn't exist in Laravel 11.
- [ ] Finish [client-side setup](https://inertiajs.com/client-side-setup). Also, add typescript support. The most easiest way to do it would be create temporary vue project with `npm install @inertiajs/vue3`, and copy files and merge settings. Make sure that you changed several files like `package.json`, `.editorconfig`, `vite.config.ts`, and so on. Change `*.js` to `*.ts`.

### Key Points

- `@inertia`
- How the `InertiaApp` resolve `*.vue` file.
